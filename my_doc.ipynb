Then conversely does it penalize defenders who anticipate well and put themselves in high tackling probability positions?\"\n","\n","#### Sort of...it's not so much penalizing as it is conveying uncertainty under the current model assumptions.\n","\n","Let's consider the example where we can have two linebackers in the hypothetical same starting position. As the ball is being thrown to a player, they start to move. Linebacker 1 follows a more optimal trajectory to the ball-carrier while linebacker 2 does not. So like said, linebacker 1 is putting himself in a higher tackling probability position. You'd correct that **if linebacker 1 makes the tackle, the ToE will be smaller than if linebacker 2 makes the tackle**, or if linebacker 1 took linebacker 2's route. \n","\n","But this isn't *penalizing* linebacker 1's Tackles over Expected (ToE):\n","\n","The expected value of Tackles over Expected is zero, independent of the probability of a tackle.\n","\n","Let's consider two linebackers who are completely the same but differ in their positioning/reactions.\n","If in 100 instances linebacker 1 has an xT=0.8, then he should get around 80 tackles, which means\n","\n","$$ToE_{1} = (1 - 0.8)*80 + (0 - 0.8)*20 = 0$$\n","\n","If in 100 instances linebacker 2 has an xT=0.2, then he should get around 20 tackles, which means\n","\n","$$ToE_{2} = (1 - 0.2)*20 + (0 - 0.2)*80 = 0$$\n","\n","So generalizing this (i.e. instead of using n=100 we take expectations), we can see \n","\n","$$E[ToE_{1}] = E[ToE_{2}] = 0$$\n","\n","The difference we pointed out earlier was the \"conditional ToE\", i.e. only looking at the ToE assuming the tackler actually makes the tackle. This difference washes out in the long run because, the linebacker putting himself in lower probability situations will make less of those tackles. So while linebacker 1 gets \"penalized\" by having a smaller ToE if he makes the tackle, linebacker 2 is \"penalized\" by more frequently having a negative ToE (because he is less likely to actually make the tackle). Intuitively this makes sense because on every play, xT is always positive. So if a player moes to a bad tackling position, he *penalizes* himself by having a smaller xT value.\n","\n","<center>\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/scottmaran/big_data_bowl_2024/blob/main/statistics/report_data/images/ex_toe_dist_1.png?raw=True\" width=50%>\n","    <br>\n","    P1 dist: mean=-0.0, var=0.16 <br>\n","    P2 dist: mean=0.0 var=0.16\n","</center>\n","\n","\n","But this assumes that both linebackers true \"talent\" is the perfectly in line with their P(tackle).

In reality, since our Tackles over Expected is an average of all our frame probabilities, and the frame probabilities are roughly continuous (e.g. since we sample every 10th of a second, the probabilities don't jump wildly from 0.2 to 0.8), and so the real distributions are much smoother (and thus the variances are closer).\n","\n","2) **A lot of this positioning ability should be seen/captured by the model**\n","\n","For a single play, if we think about what active skills a player is demonstrating at every timestep, I think a good heuristic is:\n","\n","[defensive_skill,..., defensive_skill, def_or_tackling,... ,def_or_tackling, tackling_skill,..., tackling_skill]\n","\n","In a passing play, we can think of the timestep where this shift first occurs as (roughly) the moment the quarterback releases the football. Before he throws it, he's scanning his options and a defender is trying to prevent a catch instead of make a tackle (defensive skill). So any action by defenders feels more like defensive/coverage skill rather than tackling ability.\n","\n","Immediately after he throws it, players are now moving to either break up the pass (defensive skill) or position themselves to make a tackle (tackling skill). This can be a dicey part for the model, because it's not as obvious where we should distribute value in these scenario. But since this section of the play is such a small part, it shouldn't have a large effect on the final average.\n","\n","Then the shift to only tackling skill occurs when the ball is either caught or missed, so now a player is soley trying to make a tackle (tackling skill).
