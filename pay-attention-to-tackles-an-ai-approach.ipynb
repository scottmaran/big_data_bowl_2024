    "Now we're thinking of our players as vectors that represent their position, where each entry of this vector will be a \"trait\" that the model learns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm's function is, given a sequence of vectors, update them to maximize the probability of its surroundings given any specific vector. For example, if we had a sequence such as [McCaffrey, Sneed, Aiyuk], we want to maximize:\n",
    "$$$$\n",

    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The inspiration behind this algorithm in the NLP community is that a word can be defined by the surrounding words in the sentence. Translated to sports, we can define a player's position by the other players movements around him.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're skeptical that this could work, we can walk through a small example. Let's take one potential sequence for each of the 49ers running backs:\n",
    "\n",
    "[McCaffrey (RB) - Sneed (CB) - Aiyuk (WR)]\n",
    "\n",
    "[Mitchell (RB) - Williams (LT) - Jones (DT)]\n",

    "[Jordan Mason (RB) - Williams (LT) - Derrick Nnadi (DT)]\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at these sequences, we can tell that McCaffrey is more different from Mitchell and Mason than Mitchell and Mason are with one another. Mason and Mitchell have more lineman in their sequences while McCaffrey has more defensive backs. But how does the model learn this?\n",
    "\n",
    "For sequence 1, some of the components we are maximizing are P(McCaffrey|Sneed) and P(McCaffrey|Aiyuk). If we define the likelihood of a player pair as the dot product between tehir vectors, than maximizing it constitutes making them as similar as possible. Thus we want the McCaffrey, Sneed, and Aiyuk vectors to be similar to one another. Since Sneed and Aiyuk aren't in Mitchell's (and Mason's) sequences, we don't get terms like P(Mitchell|Sneed) in their calculations, so Mitchell's vector doesn't need to be similar to Sneed or Aiyuk's.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the main steps of the Graph2Vec algorithm are:\n",
    "1) Generate random samples of node sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Use Word2Vec to get embeddings - predict the probability of a context node given the center node\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we generate these sequences tho? We take biased random walks along graph representations of the field; i.e. each node is a player and the edges are the euclidean distances between each player. The idea is that, if we are more likely to walk between players close to one another, we get sequences like the above example with the 49ers running backs"
